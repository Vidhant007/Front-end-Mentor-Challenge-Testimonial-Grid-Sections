            <h2>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h2> 
            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've sucessfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

          <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>

        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of their's who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assisstance. The agile team project in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during my interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
